# Instructions

clone or fork this repository.

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies. When that finishes, then run `npm start` to initiate the application.

## React Router Practice

The goal of this practice is to create a basic website, with a welcome, about, and contact-us page. You can be as creative as you would like for the theme, just be sure to follow the steps for the websites layout.

### **Overview:**

A few of the first steps for your react applications Route functionality has been prepared for you. Check out `index.js` and `App.js` to familiarize yourself with the layout.

### **To Do**
- You should be able to setup multiple components to be rendered on different paths. Start with the Welcome page. The `Welcome` component has already been created. You will have to setup the `<Route />` in `App.js` to display the `<Welcome />` component on your application's base URL. Remember that the `<Route/>` needs `path` and `element` props, and that a base URL has a relative path of `""`.

- Similar to the first step, you will be creating an `about` route, only this time you will also need to create the component. Create a new component called `About` that consists of a header, a paragraph about yourself or something you like, and a picture to go along with the paragraph. This component should appear in the browser when accessing `http://localhost:3000/about`, so add the necessary `<Route/>` component in `App.js` with the appropriate `path` and `element` props. 

- Just like the `About` component, you will be creating a `Contact` component and route. The relative URL should be `/contact`. This contact page should consist of a simple form asking for the users name, email, and the reason they are contacting you. The functionality for this form will only need to send the form information to the console. You won't need to actually send an email for this app.

### Stretch Goals

- Add a default route for routes you haven't created, and a component representing a 404 page to go with it! You will likely need to do some external research to figure out how to make a default route (also sometimes known as a catch route).


# Reflection
*Each activity, weâ€™ll try to give you something a little extra to think about. Write a short response to this question:*

What possible use-cases could you see routing in react being useful in your development journey?


# Submission
Submit the URL to your Github repository and your response to the reflection question.

### Grading
This activity will be graded according to the following completion criteria and learning outcomes:

#### Completion Criteria 
* Welcome component with a relative URL of '/'
* About component with a relative URL of '/about'
* About component has a header, paragraph, and image
* Contact component with a relative URL of '/contact'
* Contact component has a form with three input fields, first name, email, and message
* Contact component form submission should send data to the console

#### Stretch Goals Completion Criteria 
* Also have a 404 page
